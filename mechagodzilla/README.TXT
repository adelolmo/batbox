              The Terror of Mecha Godzilla - The True Story         

                            by Fredrik Ramsberg


This is a small interactive adventure game for PC's using MS-DOS 5.0. The
game was compiled using AM (Adventure Maker(tm)), a product of Milbus
Software. After unpacking the game in a directory of its own, this is what
you have to do to be able to play it:

               * Include the name of the directory in the PATH variable
                 declaration in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

               * Type RESTART on the last line of your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

After having done this, reboot the machine and the game will be available at
all times. Please note: You can interrupt gameplay at any time, to do
something else in DOS. As long as you don't turn off or reset the computer,
the game will always be ready for continuation. If you have trouble running
the game, make sure that you have DOS version 5.0 and that you have enough
memory space reserved for environment variables. The space reserved can be
extended using the MS-DOS command "command /e:nnnnn" when starting the
command interpreter in your config.sys. For help on this topic, type
HELP COMMAND at a DOS prompt.


If you just want to try the game without making changes to your AUTOEXEC.BAT
and CONFIG.SYS: Go to the game directory, start a new command interpreter by
typing COMMAND /E:1024 at the prompt. Then start the game with the command
RESTART. Stay in the game directory while you are playing. When you don't
want to play anymore, type EXIT to leave the new interpreter.

This game is a shareware product. You are absolutely free to distribute it
to anyone, as long as you don't take a profit from it. However, anyone who
enjoys it and decides to keep it should pay a small fee to the author. This
fee will encourage him to write more shareware programs in the future.
Also, paying the fee is helping to establish this form of distribution, as
other programmers may start using it if it works properly.

The shareware fee for this program is set to US $10. This may be sent in any
way you like to the address below. Thank you!
